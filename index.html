  <p style="text-align: center;">The AI Clinic at the University of Washington is dedicated to helping individuals and organizations to explore and realize their goals using large language models. 
    We prioritize societally beneficial projects underserved by market forces, and we work with academic labs and researchers, the public sector, and nonprofit entities.
    The clinic adopts an approach that centers open source models that support reliable and privacy-preserving systems, providing an alternative to relying on proprietary models served through web APIs.</p>
