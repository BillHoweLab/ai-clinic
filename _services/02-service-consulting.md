summary: 'Short-Term (3 months or fewer) relationships engaging CALM for ongoing research support.'

CALM offers short-term consulting relationships that can provide ongoing support for projects that would benefit from AI-driven analysis. Beyond
simply answering questions, we can assist in writing research code, selecting or designing appropriate methods for using LLMs in research, and
providing support in describing those methods during the authorship of research publications.

Short-term consulting relationships require a fee equal to the cost of supporting one graduate student for a single quarter. While this affords you
the 20 hours per week that typically come with a graduate RA-ship, you also receive the full support of the center's faculty, and access to our on-premises
computing resources.

To inquire about a short-term consulting relationship, please reach out to Director Bill Howe at [billhowe@uw.edu](billhowe@uw.edu).
