Clinic experts are available during our weekly office hours to help with a variety of issues related to using AI in research and public interest work. Appointments can be scheduled for up to one hour. All office hours are presently held over Zoom.

Office hours provide a space to engage our experts in greenfield brainstorming. We welcome discussions of how to implement ideas from recent scientific papers, translating from theoretical to applied settings. We're also happy to discuss best practices for working with AI, including estimating the confidence of general-purpose models for a specfic task of interest. While we don't provide tutorials on using AI or other technologies during office hours, our experts can provide advice on topics such as:

* Questions about fine-tuning and hosting custom models on private or open endpoints
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems connecting language models to a vector or relational database
* Design considerations around implementing models in end user applications
* Evaluation of models within a domain of interest, with real or synthetic data
* Drawing inferences from large corpora of text or images using general-purpose models
* Estimating error when using general-purpose models for quantitative analysis
* Understanding biases and limitations that might arise from using general-purpose models in research
* Technical questions related to deployment, especially surrounding open models
* Questions concerning the reproducibility of AI-driven experiments and analysis
* Open, transparent, and small-scale alternatives to large, closed models and APIs
