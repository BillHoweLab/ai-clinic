Faculty, organizations, and other members of the UW community can form a long-term consulting relationship with The AI Clinic that provides ongoing
access to the Center's expertise, students, and resources. Situations in which a long-term relationship might be appropriate include those
that are likely to last longer than three months or which may require the purchase of new resources to support the relationship.

To inquire about a long-term consulting relationship, please reach out to Director Bill Howe at [billhowe@uw.edu](billhowe@uw.edu).
