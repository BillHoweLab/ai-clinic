Faculty, organizations, and other members of the UW community can form a long-term consulting relationship with The AI Clinic that provides ongoing
access to the Center's expertise, students, and resources. Situations in which a long-term relationship might be appropriate include those
that are likely to last longer than three months or which may require the purchase of new resources to support the relationship.
